            <h3>Creativity is my Identity</h3>
            <p>Building sites with WordPress are my bread and butter. I'd estimate 90% of the work I do revolves around
                using WordPress in some way. Even if it's just for the blog I like to incorporate it as it does power
                over 40% of all websites. Whether it's theme or plugin development, I'm always excited when it comes to
                building things in Word Press.</p>
